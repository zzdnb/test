---

#### Introduction

In this report, I will detail the discussions and insights gained from a meeting with a fellow student who is working on the Eight Queens Problem, while my project focuses on the Jellybean Sequences problem. The purpose of this meeting was to explore the conjectures, proven results, and challenges each of us faced, and to find common ground where our methods or insights might overlap.

### Part 1: Jellybean Sequences

#### Problem Statement

The Jellybean Sequences problem begins with an empty jar, and over ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) days, Alice alternates between adding and removing jellybeans. The primary condition is that on the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)th day, the number of jellybeans in the jar must be a power of 2. For example, the count could be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on. The goal is to determine valid sequences of operations that satisfy this condition.

#### Observations and Key Points

1. **Initial State:** The jar starts empty with zero jellybeans.
2. **Operations:** Each day, Alice can either add a jellybean or remove one (if there are any in the jar). The number of jellybeans must always be non-negative.
3. **Power of 2 Condition:** The critical condition is that on specific days, the number of jellybeans must be a power of 2.

#### Example Sequences

Here are some sequences for an 8-day period that satisfy the given conditions:

- 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
- 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0

These sequences illustrate the alternation between adding and removing jellybeans while ensuring the count meets the power of 2 condition on the final day.

#### Mathematical Insights

1. **Initial Number:** The first number must be 1 because the jar starts empty, and Aliceâ€™s only option is to add one jellybean.
2. **Alternating Differences:** The difference between two consecutive numbers is either +1 (adding a jellybean) or -1 (removing a jellybean).
3. **Non-negative Counts:** The number of jellybeans must always be non-negative. Alice cannot remove jellybeans if the jar is already empty.
4. **Alternating Odd and Even:** The sequences demonstrate an alternating pattern of odd and even numbers.

#### Proof for Odd ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)

If ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) is odd, it is impossible to have a sequence where the jellybean count returns to 0 on the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)th day. This is because the alternation between adding and removing jellybeans ensures that the count on the final day will be odd if ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) is odd, and zero is even.

**Mathematical Formulation**: Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1,%20a_2,%20...,%20a_n) be a sequence of integers such that:

- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) is an odd positive number.
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1%20=%201).
- For each ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20\leq%20i%20<%20n), ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_i%20-%20a_{i+1}) is either -1 or 1.
- Each ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_k) is non-negative for all ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k) from 1 to ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n).

Given these conditions, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_n) must be an odd number, which implies ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_n) can never be 0 if ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) is odd. Thus, there are no valid sequences for odd ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n).

#### Enumeration of Sequences

To find the total number of valid sequences for even ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n):

- For ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20=%202), the sequence is: 1, 0. (Only 1 sequence)
- For ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20=%204), the sequences are: 1, 0, 1, 0 and 1, 2, 1, 0. (2 sequences)
- For ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20=%206), the sequences include: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0; 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0; 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0; and 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0. (5 sequences)

#### Challenges and Unresolved Questions

1. **General Formula:** While some patterns are observed, finding a general formula for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2k)) (number of valid sequences for even ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)) remains a challenge. It is known that ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2k)) is strictly increasing and that ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2k)%20<%20M(2k)), where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M(2k)) is the total number of sequences without the non-negative constraint.
2. **Computational Approach:** A computational approach can be used to enumerate sequences for larger ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n). This involves traversing a binary tree where each left move corresponds to adding a jellybean, and each right move corresponds to removing a jellybean, ensuring non-negative counts throughout.

#### Proof by Enumeration and Recursion

1. **Recursive Definition:** Define ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(n)) as the number of valid sequences of length ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) that end with zero jellybeans. Base cases: ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2)%20=%201), ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(4)%20=%202), ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(6)%20=%205).
2. **Recurrence Relation:** To derive ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2k)), we consider extending the sequences in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2(k-1))). Each valid sequence in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2(k-1))) can be extended by adding one jellybean followed by removing one jellybean, ensuring non-negative counts.
3. **General Case:** The general case involves recursively applying the recurrence relation to build larger sequences from smaller ones.

#### Computational Implementation

To validate the enumeration and find sequences for larger values of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n), we implemented a computational approach using Python.

```python
def is_valid_sequence(seq):
    count = 0
    for num in seq:
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1
        if count < 0:
            return False
    return count == 0

def generate_sequences(n):
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return []
    sequences = []
    def backtrack(seq, count):
        if len(seq) == n:
            if is_valid_sequence(seq):
                sequences.append(seq[:])
            return
        if count > 0:
            seq.append(0)
            backtrack(seq, count - 1)
            seq.pop()
        seq.append(1)
        backtrack(seq, count + 1)
        seq.pop()
    
    backtrack([], 0)
    return sequences

# Example usage: find sequences for 8 steps
sequences = generate_sequences(8)
for seq in sequences:
    print(seq)
```

This algorithm uses backtracking to explore all possible sequences and validates each sequence to ensure it meets the required conditions.

### Part 2: Eight Queens Problem

#### Problem Statement

The Eight Queens Problem is a classic puzzle where the goal is to

place 8 queens on an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?8%20\times%208) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

#### Observations and Key Points

1. **Non-attacking Conditions:** Each queen must be placed such that it does not share the same row, column, or diagonal with any other queen.
2. **Backtracking Algorithm:** A common approach to solving this problem is using backtracking, which explores possible queen placements row by row and prunes branches where a conflict arises.

#### Example Solution

One valid arrangement for the queens is:

- [1, 5, 8, 6, 3, 7, 2, 4]
- This means placing queens at positions (1,1), (2,5), (3,8), (4,6), (5,3), (6,7), (7,2), and (8,4).

#### Algorithm Implementation

The backtracking algorithm involves:

1. **Recursive Function:** Place queens one row at a time. Check for conflicts in columns and diagonals before placing a queen.
2. **Conflict Check:** Ensure no two queens are in the same column or diagonal.

#### Mathematical Proof

To prove that a given arrangement is valid, we ensure that no two queens attack each other. This involves checking the following conditions for each pair of queens:

- They do not share the same row.
- They do not share the same column.
- They do not share the same diagonal.

**Mathematical Formulation**: Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_i) represent the column position of the queen in the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i)th row. For a valid configuration:

- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_i%20\neq%20q_j) for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20\neq%20j) (no two queens share the same column).
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?|q_i%20-%20q_j|%20\neq%20|i%20-%20j|) for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20\neq%20j) (no two queens share the same diagonal).

By ensuring these conditions are met, we can validate the arrangement as a solution to the Eight Queens Problem.

#### Backtracking Algorithm

The following Python code demonstrates the backtracking approach to solve the Eight Queens Problem:

```python
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i] == col or \
           board[i] - i == col - row or \
           board[i] + i == col + row:
            return False
    return True

def solve_n_queens(n):
    def backtrack(board, row):
        if row == n:
            result.append(board[:])
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if is_safe(board, row, col):
                board[row] = col
                backtrack(board, row + 1)
                board[row] = -1
    
    result = []
    board = [-1] * n
    backtrack(board, 0)
    return result

# Example usage: find solutions for 8 queens
solutions = solve_n_queens(8)
for solution in solutions:
    print(solution)
```

This algorithm uses recursion to place queens row by row, checking for conflicts before placing each queen. It backtracks when a conflict is detected, ensuring all possible valid configurations are explored.

#### Extensions and Generalizations

1. **![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)-Queens Problem:** The Eight Queens Problem can be generalized to the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)-Queens Problem, where the goal is to place ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) queens on an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20\times%20n) chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
2. **Higher Dimensions:** The problem can also be extended to higher dimensions, where queens are placed on a ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k)-dimensional chessboard.
3. **Optimizations:** Various optimizations can be applied to improve the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm, such as heuristic-based pruning and symmetry breaking.

### Expanded Discussion and Mathematical Proofs

#### Common Ground

Both the Jellybean Sequences and the Eight Queens Problem require solving complex combinatorial puzzles through exhaustive search and validation. The backtracking technique is pivotal in both cases, allowing us to explore potential solutions while pruning paths that violate the given constraints. This common ground underscores the versatility of backtracking in tackling various combinatorial challenges.

#### Insights Exchange

1. **Backtracking Techniques:**
   
   - **Jellybean Sequences:** By using backtracking, we generate all possible sequences of adding and removing jellybeans. At each step, we check if the sequence remains valid (i.e., the number of jellybeans is non-negative). This method efficiently narrows down the potential sequences to those that meet the power of 2 condition.
   - **Eight Queens Problem:** In the Eight Queens Problem, backtracking is used to place each queen on the board one row at a time. If placing a queen results in a conflict (same row, column, or diagonal as another queen), the algorithm backtracks and tries a different position. This systematic approach ensures that only valid placements are explored.
2. **Mathematical Proofs:**
   
   - **Eight Queens Problem:** To prove a solution's validity, we ensure no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_i) represent the column position of the queen in the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i)th row. For a valid configuration:
     - ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_i%20\neq%20q_j) for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20\neq%20j) (no two queens share the same column).
     - ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?|q_i%20-%20q_j|%20\neq%20|i%20-%20j|) for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20\neq%20j) (no two queens share the same diagonal).
   - **Jellybean Sequences:** The validation process in the Eight Queens Problem inspired a similar approach for the Jellybean Sequences. Ensuring that the sequence of jellybeans remains non-negative and meets the power of 2 condition can be validated systematically at each step, similar to how queen placements are validated.

#### Collaborative Question

The core question we explored was how the mathematical validation techniques used in the Eight Queens Problem could be adapted to the Jellybean Sequences problem. Specifically, we discussed:

- **Constraint Validation:** Just as queens must not attack each other, the sequence of jellybean counts must always be non-negative and meet the power of 2 condition on specified days. We considered how to systematically validate these constraints using a similar backtracking approach.
- **Optimization Techniques:** We examined how the pruning strategies in the Queens Problem could help in efficiently discarding invalid jellybean sequences early in the search process.

#### Progress Made

1. **Algorithm Enhancements:**
   - **

Backtracking Optimization:** We considered several enhancements to the backtracking approach, such as using heuristic-based pruning to prioritize more promising branches, reducing the overall computational effort.

- **Computational Methods:** We explored the use of dynamic programming and memoization to store and reuse previously computed results, thus avoiding redundant calculations and improving efficiency in both problems.

2. **Conceptual Understanding:**
   
   - **Combinatorial Search:** The discussions deepened our understanding of combinatorial search problems. We shared techniques for efficiently navigating large search spaces and ensuring that only valid configurations are considered.
   - **Efficient Validation:** Emphasized the importance of efficient validation methods to quickly discard invalid configurations, thus saving computational resources.
3. **Mathematical Proofs:**
   
   - **Eight Queens Problem:** The mathematical proof involves checking that no two queens attack each other. Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_i) be the column of the queen in the ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i)th row. The conditions are:
     - ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?q_i%20\neq%20q_j) for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20\neq%20j).
     - ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?|q_i%20-%20q_j|%20\neq%20|i%20-%20j|) for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20\neq%20j).
   - **Jellybean Sequences:** The sequences are validated by ensuring non-negative counts and meeting the power of 2 condition at specific steps. This can be systematically checked at each step in the sequence, similar to the placement of queens.

### Questions and Discussions

#### Jellybean Sequences Questions:

1. **How can we derive a general formula for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2k))?**
   
   - **Answer:** Deriving a general formula for ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2k)) involves understanding the combinatorial nature of valid sequences. By analyzing the recursive patterns and constructing a recurrence relation, we can attempt to express ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S(2k)) in terms of previously computed values. The challenge lies in ensuring the non-negative constraint and the power of 2 condition at each step.
2. **What are the computational limits for generating sequences for large ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)?**
   
   - **Answer:** The computational limits are influenced by the exponential growth in the number of potential sequences as ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n) increases. Using advanced techniques such as dynamic programming and memoization can help manage these limits by reusing previously computed results. Additionally, parallel computing methods can distribute the computational load and enhance efficiency.
3. **Can dynamic programming be applied to optimize the sequence generation?**
   
   - **Answer:** Yes, dynamic programming is well-suited for optimizing the generation of valid sequences. By storing intermediate results in a table and using them to construct longer sequences, we can significantly reduce redundant calculations. This approach ensures that the sequence generation process is both efficient and scalable.
4. **How does the constraint of non-negative counts influence the enumeration process?**
   
   - **Answer:** The non-negative constraint introduces additional complexity to the enumeration process. Each step must check and ensure that the number of jellybeans does not fall below zero. This constraint can be incorporated into the backtracking algorithm by adding a condition to prune branches that violate this rule, thus reducing the number of potential sequences to be evaluated.
5. **What role do combinatorial patterns play in solving the Jellybean Sequences problem?**
   
   - **Answer:** Combinatorial patterns help identify the structural properties of valid sequences. By recognizing these patterns, we can simplify the enumeration process and derive insights that lead to a more generalized solution. Patterns such as alternating additions and subtractions and their impact on reaching powers of 2 are crucial for formulating a systematic approach to the problem.

#### Eight Queens Problem Questions:

1. **How does the backtracking algorithm scale with larger ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)-Queens problems?**
   
   - **Answer:** The backtracking algorithm scales exponentially with larger ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n)-Queens problems due to the increased number of possible configurations. However, optimizations such as pruning invalid branches early and using heuristic-based placements can significantly improve scalability. Advanced data structures like bitsets can also enhance efficiency by quickly checking for conflicts.
2. **What are the most effective pruning strategies in backtracking for the Queens Problem?**
   
   - **Answer:** Effective pruning strategies include constraint propagation, where placing a queen immediately updates the board to reflect forbidden positions, and forward checking, which predicts conflicts ahead of time. Additionally, using domain reduction techniques, such as eliminating rows and columns already occupied by queens, can reduce the search space and speed up the solution process.
3. **Can the solution to the Eight Queens Problem be used to inform other combinatorial optimization problems?**
   
   - **Answer:** Yes, the principles and techniques used in solving the Eight Queens Problem can be applied to other combinatorial optimization problems. For example, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in scheduling, resource allocation, and puzzle-solving can benefit from similar backtracking and pruning methods. The insights gained from handling constraints and validating configurations are broadly applicable.
4. **How can we prove that all valid solutions have been found without missing any configurations?**
   
   - **Answer:** To prove that all valid solutions have been found, we can use exhaustive search algorithms combined with mathematical induction. By ensuring that every possible configuration is explored and validated, and by showing that the algorithm covers the entire solution space without gaps, we can confidently assert the completeness of the solution set. Additionally, cross-verifying results using different algorithms can provide further assurance.
5. **What mathematical properties of chessboard configurations are relevant to the Eight Queens Problem?**
   
   - **Answer:** Relevant mathematical properties include symmetry, permutations, and the combinatorial nature of placing non-attacking pieces. Understanding these properties helps in constructing efficient algorithms and proving the validity of solutions. For instance, leveraging symmetries can reduce the search space by identifying equivalent configurations, while permutations can help systematically explore all possible placements.
6. **What is the basic goal of the Eight Queens Problem?**
   
   - **Answer:** The goal is to place eight queens on an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?8%20\times%208) chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.
7. **Why can't two queens be in the same row or column?**
   
   - **Answer:** In chess, a queen can move any number of squares vertically or horizontally. If two queens are in the same row or column, one could attack the other. The challenge of the problem is to avoid such placements to ensure none of the queens can capture another.
8. **How do we check if two queens are in the same diagonal?**
   
   - **Answer:** Two queens are in the same diagonal if the absolute difference between their row indices equals the absolute difference between their column indices. Mathematically, queens at positions ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(r_1,%20c_1)) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(r_2,%20c_2)) are in the same diagonal if ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?|r_1%20-%20r_2|%20=%20|c_1%20-%20c_2|). This means that if you subtract the row number of one queen from the row number of the other queen, and do the same for the column numbers, the results should be the same for them to be on the same diagonal.
9. **What is backtracking, and how is it used in solving the Eight Queens Problem?**
   
   - **Answer:** Backtracking is a method of exploring possible configurations of a problem to find a solution. In the Eight Queens Problem, it involves placing a queen in a row and recursively attempting to place the remaining queens in subsequent rows. If a conflict is detected, the algorithm backtracks to the previous row to try a different column for the queen.
10. **Why is the Eight Queens Problem considered a combinatorial problem?**

- **Answer:** It's considered a combinatorial problem because it involves finding a specific arrangement of queens among the many possible combinations on the board. The challenge lies in exploring these combinations efficiently and validating them against the problem's constraints.

11. **Can the Eight Queens Problem have multiple solutions?**

- **Answer:** Yes, there are multiple solutions to the Eight Queens Problem. Different valid configurations of queens can satisfy the problem's constraints. The total number of distinct solutions for the Eight Queens Problem is 92.

12. **How does symmetry help in reducing the number of solutions we need to check?**

- **Answer:** Symmetry in the chessboard allows us to reduce the number of configurations by recognizing that certain placements are essentially the same due to rotation or reflection. By identifying these symmetrical solutions, we can avoid redundant checks and focus on unique configurations.

#### Cross-Problem Discussions:

1. **How can insights from the Eight Queens Problem's validation process be applied to the Jellybean Sequences?**
   
   - **Answer:** The validation process in the Eight Queens Problem involves systematically checking for conflicts, which can be adapted to the Jellybean Sequences problem by ensuring non-negative counts and power of 2 conditions. Techniques such as constraint propagation and forward checking can be used to validate jellybean sequences at each step, ensuring that only valid sequences are generated.
2. **Are there heuristic methods used in one problem that can be beneficial for the other?**
   
   - **Answer:** Yes, heuristic methods such as prioritizing certain placements or moves based on their likelihood of leading to a solution can be beneficial in both problems. For instance, in the Eight Queens Problem, placing queens in central positions first can reduce conflicts. Similarly, in the Jellybean Sequences, starting with sequences that quickly reach powers of 2 can help narrow down valid configurations.
3. **What are the similarities and differences in the search spaces of both problems?**
   
   - **Answer:** The search spaces of both problems are combinatorial in nature, involving the exploration of numerous potential configurations. However, the Eight Queens Problem has a fixed spatial constraint on a chessboard, while the Jellybean Sequences problem involves numerical constraints over time. Both problems require efficient search strategies and validation techniques to navigate their respective search spaces effectively.
4. **How can computational methods be shared and adapted between the two problems to enhance efficiency?**
   
   - **Answer:** Computational methods such as backtracking, dynamic programming, and heuristic-based pruning can be adapted and shared between the two problems. By leveraging common strategies for exploring and validating configurations, we can enhance efficiency. For example, memoization techniques used in dynamic programming for Jellybean Sequences can be applied to store intermediate results in the Eight Queens Problem, reducing redundant calculations.
5. **What are the potential applications of solving these combinatorial problems beyond theoretical interest?**
   
   - **Answer:** Solving combinatorial problems like the Jellybean Sequences and Eight Queens Problem has practical applications in fields such as operations research, computer science, and artificial intelligence. These solutions can inform algorithms for resource allocation, scheduling, optimization, and even cryptography. The techniques developed for these problems can be adapted to solve real-world challenges that involve complex constraints and large search spaces.

### Conclusion

This meeting was a valuable exercise in collaborative learning and problem-solving. By exploring the Jellybean Sequences and Eight Queens Problem together, we were able to share insights, discuss challenges, and enhance our understanding of combinatorial search techniques.
